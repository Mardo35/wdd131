        <h1>What is <em>Creatine</em>?</h1>

        <p>
         <em>Creatine</em> is one of the most known supplement in the fitness industry, and also the most researched supplement,it is often associated with "Pump" "hairloss", is it really what it is?   
        </p>
        <p>It was first identified in 1832 by French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, who extracted it from beef bouillon and named it after kreas, the Greek word for flesh, it is a naturally occurring nitrogenous organic acid that plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism. It is primarily stored in skeletal muscle, where it facilitates the rapid regeneration of adenosine triphosphate (ATP)—the body’s fundamental energy currency—during high-intensity physical activity. </p>
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
<p>Creatine is a naturally occurring compound that helps supply energy to all cells in the body, primarily muscles. It increases the availability of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which acts as the primary fuel source for short bursts of high-intensity energy during exercise.</p>

<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>When you supplement with creatine, you increase your body's stores of phosphocreatine. This stored form of cellular energy helps your body rapidly regenerate ATP. Essentially, it allows you to perform more repetitions, lift heavier weights, and recover faster between sets by keeping your muscular "batteries" charged.</p>

<h2>Creatine Benefits</h2>
<p>The primary benefits include significant gains in muscle strength, power output, and lean muscle mass. Beyond the gym, research suggests creatine can also support cognitive function, reduce mental fatigue, and improve recovery times after intense physical exertion.</p>

<h2>Creatine side effects</h2>
<p>Creatine is one of the most extensively researched supplements and is considered very safe for long-term use. The most common side effect is slight water retention within the muscle cells. Some users may experience mild digestive discomfort if they take too much at once without sufficient water.</p>

<h2>When to take creatine?</h2>
<p>Consistency matters more than precise timing. While some prefer taking it pre-workout for a mental boost or post-workout with a protein shake to aid uptake, the goal is simply to keep your muscle stores saturated. Taking it at the same time every day—regardless of when you train—is the most effective strategy.</p>

<h2>How much creatine you should take?</h2>
<p>A standard daily dose of 3–5 grams of Creatine Monohydrate is sufficient for most people to maintain peak muscle saturation. While some choose to do a "loading phase" of 20 grams per day for the first week to see results faster, a steady 5-gram daily dose will reach the same level of effectiveness within 3 to 4 weeks.</p>

        <h2>Common Creatine Myths</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Myth: It's a steroid.</strong><br> 
                Reality: It is a natural amino acid derivative found in red meat and fish; it does not affect hormones like steroids.</li>
            <li><strong>Myth: It causes hair loss.</strong><br> 
                Reality: There is no strong clinical evidence linking creatine to hair loss; the original study suggesting this has never been replicated.</li>
            <li><strong>Myth: It damages kidneys.</strong><br> 
                Reality: In healthy individuals, it is proven safe. Only those with pre-existing kidney conditions should consult a doctor.</li>
